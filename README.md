# Pocket Crystal League -- PortMaster Fork
This is a fork of [Pocket Crystal League](https://gitlab.com/moodytail/pokecards) from the `2024/06/18 update v2.3.1.0`. The only difference with this fork, which is used for the [PortMaster distribution](https://portmaster.games/detail.html?name=pocketcrystalleague), is externalized audio. 
The original game uses embedded audio with music taken straight from Pokemon TCG GameBoy Color. This fork swaps that music for arranged variations more befitting to the GameBoy Advance theme.

## Building
You can compile this project with Game Maker Studio. If you intend to use the completed binary as a drop-in for the PortMaster distribution, please build the project with GMS runtime v2023.8.0.145. You can build for any platform, just rename the file to `game.droid` and replace the existing one in your
PortMaster port folder.
